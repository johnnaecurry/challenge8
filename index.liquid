<h1>My Favorite Place: <strong>The DIA</strong></h1>

<p> Sometimes you just need a change of scenery, and the Detroit Institute of Arts delivers every time.

From the moment I walked in, the energy of the place pulled me in. Diego Rivera’s Detroit Industry murals are jaw-dropping in person — massive, colorful, alive. I could’ve stayed in that room for hours.

The museum winds through centuries and continents, from calm Dutch still lifes to bold modern sculptures. I especially loved the African and Indigenous American galleries — full of art that feels deeply rooted and powerful.

After a coffee at the café and a quick stop at the gift shop (yes, I bought a Frida Kahlo postcard), I left feeling recharged and inspired.

If you're in Detroit, don’t miss the DIA. It's a few hours that can change the way you see the world. </p>
